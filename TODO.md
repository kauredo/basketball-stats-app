# TODO

## WEB & MOBILE:

1.  need to be able to set the starting 5 before the game starts.
2.  Are heatmaps working as expected?
3.  move shot and game clock management to another tab, so that people can focus on one thing at a time, and we can have multiple people managing different parts of the game at the same time through different devices.

## WEB:

1.  Live Screen was supposed to all fit in the screen, but it's not. The court is cutoff on the bottom. Think its probably just too big?

## MOBILE:

1.  touch selector not working as expected, court is being clipped and the touch is not rendering in the correct place. It is registering in the right place, but not rendering correctly on mobile.
2.  In "plays" tab in live game, the events are not showing all relevant information. Also getting "VirtualizedLists should never be nested inside plain ScrollViews" error message in the console.
3.  Settings in Dashboard, should be in the Profile tab.
4.  statistics tab is completely different from the rest of app, so is settings header.
5.  teams tab should allow clicking into a team to view and edit the roster and team information.
6.  Could not end period in live game.
7.  Landscape view is cutoff on bottom and scrolling is impossible. For the live game tab, lets see if we can avoid scrolling.
