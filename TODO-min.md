# TODO-min

This is a minimum, user-managed TODO. As an agent, you should read this file, and update TODO.md with a more detailed version of these TODOs. The user will read TODO.md.

## TODO

- [ ] Cleanup TODO.md TODOs
- [x] Mobile app game export button and modal have very weird styling
- [x] ERROR in mobile app - CreatePlayerScreen infinite loop (fixed with useMemo)
- [x] ERROR in mobile app - removeNotificationSubscription deprecated (fixed with .remove())
- [ ] ERROR in mobile app - expo-notifications warnings in Expo Go (requires dev build)
- [ ] ERROR in mobile app - ENOENT source map issue (Metro bundler path resolution - cosmetic)
- [x] Lists with users or teams, or game cards (even scheduled games) should be clickable. This should work across the app, in both web and mobile.
- [x] When we are adding a stat, through the quick actions or the shot recording, we should add separation between players of different teams. This should also be colour coded.
- [x] On the shot recording, we should be able to filter by team or player, plus the icons should be different for each team.
